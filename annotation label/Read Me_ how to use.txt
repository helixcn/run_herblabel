If you have herblabel (https://github.com/helixcn/herblabel) installed in R, please follow the steps to create annotation labels: 

1. Fill the Annotation_label_data.xlsx. Put Scientific Name or Chinese Name at the column "LOCAL_NAME"

2. Double click "print_annotation_labels_normal.bat" or "print_annotation_labels_without_family.bat" if you do not want the Family to be printed. 

3. check the annotation labels from "annotation_labels_to_print.rtf"

Note: 
(1) Please close "Annotation_label_data.xlsx" or "annotation_labels_to_print.rtf" before printing. 
(2) Please change the property of the cells containing dates as "text", so excel will not change the text to numbers.
