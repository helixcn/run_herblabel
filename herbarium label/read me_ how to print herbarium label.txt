If you have herblabel (https://github.com/helixcn/herblabel) installed in R, please follow the steps to create annotation labels: 

1. Export Specimen Information from BG-BASE specimen table using slist by copying the commands in the file "step 0 export specimen records from BG_BASE using SLIST.txt" from BG-BASE. A CSV file named "BG_BASE_EXPORT.CSV" will be generated in the current directory. 

2. Double Click "step 1 convert_BG-BASE.bat" to convert this CSV to darwin format template. After converting to DARWIN Core Format, the csv file （BG_BASE_EXPORT.CSV） will be renamed to (CONVERTED_BG_BASE_EXPORT.CSV). 

3. Check and Fill the herbarium_specimens_label_data.xlsx template. Put Scientific Name or Chinese Name at the column "LOCAL_NAME". 

4. Double click "step 2 fill template and print_labels.bat", and view the herbarium labels from "herbarium_labels_to_print.rtf". 

Note: 
(1)Please close "herbarium_labels_to_print.rtf" or "herbarium_specimens_label_data.xlsx" before printing. 

(2)Please fill the herbarium_specimens_label_data.xlsx template directly if your collection record is not from BG-BASE, and then click "step 2 fill template and print_labels.bat". 

(3) Please change the property of the cells containing dates as "text", so excel will not change the text to numbers.
